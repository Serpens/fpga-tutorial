# FPGA

We'll be working in the `verilog` directory.

## Setup

1. You will need Verilog setup from the [previous step](verilog.html). Remember
   to also initialize the Git submodule with libraries:

       git submodule update --init

2. Then, install the [Icestorm toolchain](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/). The
   easiest way is using the [apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) project:

       pip3 install --user apio
       apio install icestorm

   This will download and unpack the necessary software in your home directory
   (under `~/.apio`). If you want to run the tools directly (not only from
   Makefile), add the toolchain to your `PATH`, for instance in your `.bashrc`:

       export PATH="$HOME/.apio/packages/toolchain-icestorm/bin/:$PATH"

3. Under Linux, add yourself to the `dialout` group so that you can connect to the
   chip without sudo: (TODO: This doesn't seem to work for everyone, use
   `USE_SUDO=1`)

       sudo adduser $USER dialout

    You will need to log out and log in again.

4. Now try uploading a design. Connect the Icestick board, and run:

       make flash V=blinky_icestick.v

   If for some reason you need sudo, append `USE_SUDO=1`.

   If you encounter problems under Mac OS X, see [Project IceStorm â€“ Notes for
   Installing on OSX](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/notes_osx.html).
   You will probably need to unload Apple's FTDI driver:

       sudo kextunload com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI

5. For the TinyFPGA BX board, you need to additionally do the following:

       pip3 install --user tinyprog
       apio drivers --serial-enable

## Building and flashing

To upload a design, use `make flash`. For example:

    make flash V=blinky_icestick.v

For the TinyFPGA BX module, you need to set `BOARD=bx` flag:

    make flash V=blinky_bx.v BOARD=bx

Same for the IceBreaker module:

    make flash V=blinky_icebreaker.v BOARD=icebreaker

(Append `USE_SUDO=1` if you need to use sudo).

The build process has the following steps:

1. Logic synthesis, using `yosys`. This produces a `.blif` file with your
   design compiled down to components available on the FPGA chip (look-up
   tables, flip-flops, block RAMs, etc.)
2. Place and route, using `arachne-pnr`. This produces `.asc` and then `.bin`
   files containing the final chip configuration (a bitstream).
3. Programming the chip, using `iceprog` / `tinyprog`. This uploads the `.bin`
   to the chip over USB.

## Pins

You can find the available pins in
[fpga-tools/pcf](https://github.com/pwmarcz/fpga-tools/tree/master/pcf) directory. Your module
will need to reference these.

Here are the pinouts for reference:

- [iCEstick pinout](http://www.pighixxx.net/portfolio-items/icestick/)
- [TinyFPGA BX pinout](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-bx/updates/manufacturing-continues)
- [IceBreaker pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker/master/img/icebreaker-v1_0b-legend.jpg)

## Ideas

Here is a list of ideas that you can implement. You will find some hints
regarding different parts in the next section.

- **Counter**: Implement a counter that increases every second. The Icestick
  has 5 LEDs, you can use them to show an increasing 5-bit number.
  - Try connecting the segment display.
  - Connect a button. Make the counter increase not with time, but every time
    the button is pressed. Add a reset button.
- **Traffic lights**: Implement the traffic lights example from the previous
  chapter. You will need three LEDs (don't forget the resistors!) and a button.
- **Fade LEDs in and out** by implementing pulse-width modulation.
- **Serial link**: Use the chip to communicate with computer over the serial
  link.
  - Memory buffer: Implement a chip that has a small memory buffer and responds
    to "read" and "write" commands.
- **Screens**: Draw something on the screen. Create an animation. Send a
  picture over the serial link and draw it.
  - Pong game?
  - Game of Life demo.
  - Display text. [Unscii 8x8 bitmap fonts](http://pelulamu.net/unscii/) might
    come in handy, you can download the fonts in a hex format which is
    basically a one byte, one row bitmap. And here is a font [converted to
    column-by-column](https://github.com/pwmarcz/fpga-experiments/blob/master/font.mem)
    already.

## Parts

Here are some parts you can use in your projects.

### Clock

The Icestick has a 12 MHz clock signal, the BX a 16 MHz one. For changes that a
human can notice, you will need to divide it to create a slower clock. See the
`blinky` example.

It's also possible to [get a faster clock using a
PLL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43890771/how-to-get-a-faster-clock-in-verilog-on-a-lattice-icestick),
but I haven't tried that yet. The `icetime` tool should tell you the maximum
frequency for your design (run `make time`). Use `icepll` to generate the
right parameters for the PLL module.

### LEDs

The Icestick has 5 LEDs, the BX has one. You can turn them on and off just by
specifying the pins in module output.

You can connect your own LEDs as well, just make sure to connect the right
resistors. The voltage on pins is 3.3 V.

### Buttons and switches

You will need a pull-down or pull-up resistor. See for instance the [button
example for Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button).

You can also use a an internal pull-up from FPGA. See `button.v` on how to do
that.

### Seven-segment display

Here is a [spec sheet for the
display](https://botland.com.pl/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=1629). Ours
has a common anode for all 4 digits. You will need to display the digits one at a time. Here is [a blog post on multiplexing 7 segment display](https://www.electronicsblog.net/4-digits-7-segments-led-display-multiplexing-with-arduino/).

(TODO add more info once we try that)

### Serial link (UART)

You can use the chip on Icestick to communicate with your computer over a
serial connection (exposed as a second USB device; visible under `/dev/ttyUSB1`
under Linux).

See `uart_hello.v` for a simple program that sends "Hello, world!"
repeatedly. You can use `uart.py` to receive the data. Here is the
[documentation for pySerial
library](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/pyserial_api.html). Remember to set
the baud rate correctly on both ends!

You can also use a serial terminal such as `gtkterm` (see for instance
[Communicate with hardware using USB cable for
Ubuntu](https://elinux.org/Communicate_with_hardware_using_USB_cable_for_Ubuntu)).

Note that the module we're using, `uart.v`, is a [third-party software
developed by Tim Goddard](https://github.com/cyrozap/osdvu).

### OLED displays

I have two OLED screens:

- "Two-color" (actually monochrome) 128x64 screen. The data is laid out in 8
  rows of 128 bytes each. Each row describes a 128x8 strip, each byte is a 1x8
  segment.
- 65536-color 96x64 screen. Each pixel is 16 bits. Note that this is more
  memory that Icestick has on board (12 KB; the Icestick's block RAMs hold 8 KB
  total).

See `oled_pattern.v` and `oled_pattern_color.v` for details on how to use.

You might want to load some initial data into memory. You can use the
[`$readmemh`
function](https://timetoexplore.net/blog/initialize-memory-in-verilog) to do
that.
