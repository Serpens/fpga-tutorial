# FPGA tutorial

This tutorial has the following parts:

1. Play the excellent [NandGame](http://nandgame.com/). Try to get at least to
   "Data Flip-Flop".

2. If you are not familiar with bit operations, learn a bit about them. There
   are some links and exercises in the [bits/](bits/) directory.

3. Move on to Verilog basics in the [verilog/](verilog/) directory.

4. Finally, we get to play with real hardware. See the [fpga/](fpga/) directory.
