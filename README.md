# FPGA tutorial

This tutorial has the following parts:

## [NandGame](http://nandgame.com/)

Play the excellent [NandGame](http://nandgame.com/). Try to get at least to
"Data Flip-Flop".

## [Bit operations](bits/)

If you are not familiar with bit operations, learn a bit about them. There
are some links and exercises in the [bits/](bits/) directory.

## [Verilog basics](verilog/)

Move on to Verilog basics in the [verilog/](verilog/) directory.

## [FPGA](fpga/)

Finally, we get to play with real hardware. See the [fpga/](fpga/) directory.
